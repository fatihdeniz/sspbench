TrustEval Documentation
========================

`TrustEval` is a modular and extensible toolkit for comprehensive trust evaluation of generative foundation models (GenFMs). This toolkit enables you to evaluate models across various dimensions such as safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and more.

**Key Features**

- **Dynamic Dataset Generation**: Automatically generate datasets tailored for evaluation tasks.
- **Multi-Model Compatibility**: Evaluate LLMs, VLMs, T2I models, and more.
- **Customizable Metrics**: Configure workflows with flexible metrics and evaluation methods.
- **Metadata-Driven Pipelines**: Design and execute test cases efficiently using metadata.
- **Comprehensive Dimensions**: Evaluate models across safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and truthfulness.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate interactive, easy-to-interpret evaluation reports.

.. About TrustEval
.. ===============

.. TrustEval is designed to help researchers and practitioners assess the trustworthiness of generative foundation models (GenFMs), such as large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and text-to-image (T2I) models. 

.. The toolkit's modular architecture enables users to:

.. - Dynamically generate datasets.
.. - Evaluate models on safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and other dimensions.
.. - Customize evaluation metrics and workflows.
.. - Generate detailed, interactive reports for comparative analysis.

.. For more details, please refer to the **Quick Start** section or explore the **Modules** for specific functionality.
